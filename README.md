## 2 Overview


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


As of 2021, the pet ownership rate in North America is estimated to be around 68% of households. This includes ownership of dogs, cats, birds, fish, reptiles, and other animals. Where do people get their pets? Would high pet ownership lead to a high rate of surrendering animals? The data from Austin Animal Center intake and outcome could help us approach the issue of animal welfare and operation conditions of animal shelter. It would help both shelter staff and people who want to get a pet to make better decisions in adopting pets.


## 3 Data and Data Preprocessing

3.1 Description of data



* The dataset contains information on animal intakes and outcomes at the Austin Animal Center, which is the largest no-kill animal shelter in the United States. The data covers the period from October 2013 to March 2018. Each record represents a unique animal intake or outcome and includes information. The primary key is combination of animal_ID & intake_number.

## 3.2 Data Preprocessing

The data processing was done through JavaScript in the main.js, bubble.js and lines.js file, and includes:

1. Round the Age to whole years

2. Converting number strings Days to integer values

3. Group the corresponding data for visualization use.

4. Create new age group column based on age conditions

5. Join two intake & outcome csv files for line chart use

Design Rationale

We want to create this general filter and put it on the first of the page to let users find it and use it. We choose the same color hue with 5.5 bubble plot to enhance the impression of difference between animals.

Interaction

Creating a filter

The UI widget type filter could filter one or more animals to view 5.3 Line Chart of Net Flow of Animals, 5.4 Heat Map, 5.5 bubble plot and 5.6 Bar chart of Age Group VS Line chart of average Days in Shelter. In default, the four animals are all deselected and all categories are shown. 


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


After the user clicks on an animal, it becomes active and all other categories are hidden in the chart. Users should be able to select multiple categories and a second click on an active category sets it inactive.

Filter Combination

	5.1 type filter could be used together with any one of 5.2 stack brush, 5.4 heatmap selector, 5.5 bubble plot selector and 5.6 bar chart selector

  </tr>
</table>


Design Rationale

In order to effectively display the intake and outcome numbers of an animal shelter, we have chosen to use a split stacked line graph, with time on the x-axis and animal numbers on the y-axis. The use of positive values for intake numbers and negative values for outcome numbers provides an easy way for viewers to understand the net change in animal numbers over time. Additionally, the shape of the intake and outcome lines can provide valuable insights into trends and patterns that may be useful for making decisions about adoption campaigns or outreach efforts.

To increase the clarity of the chart, we have employed a color scheme with two distinct colors to differentiate between intake and outcome data. This helps viewers quickly identify which sections of the chart correspond to each data point. Furthermore, we have added a hidden line to show data for selected types, which only appears when the user selects at least one type. This provides a more personalized and informative view of the data, allowing viewers to focus on specific types of animals or other factors of interest.

To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data, we have also included a legend on the chart, which allows viewers to easily read the total intake and outcome numbers for the current time range. These design choices make our chart more user-friendly and informative, helping viewers to quickly and easily understand the data being presented.

Interaction

* Filter the time and interact with other views


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


When a user slelcts a time range, the stacked line graph, line chart of net flow, bar chart, bubble plot and heatmap will all show the data accordingly. And when we click the blank space, the timeline will change back to the default time domain. Also, other filters except 5.1 type filter would be eliminated.

Filter Combination

	5.2 stack brush could be used together with 5.1 type filter, then any one of 5.4 heatmap selector, 5.5 bubble plot selector and 5.6 bar chart selector. However, the user must first choose 5.2 stack brush, then use 5.4 / 5.5 / 5.6 filter. The pre-existing 5.4 / 5.5 / 5.6 filter would be eliminated after using 5.2 stack brush

Receving Filter from Other Views 

	Filter a specific animal type and interact with other views 


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


When we click a type, the stacked line graph will generate an intake line and a outcome line of the animal type that we select so that the we can see the intake and outcome trend of this animal type. If we select more than one type, the lines will show the general trend of types selected.

Design Rationale

We use line graph to show the net flow of animals in an animal shelter over time. With time on the x-axis and net animal numbers on the y-axis, this graph allows viewers to easily see the net change in animal numbers over time. By using a line graph in this way, users can quickly identify trends and patterns in animal intake and outcome, and track changes in the overall animal population of the shelter.

Furthermore, the plot points on this graph provide detailed information about the net flow and trends of animals in the shelter. By examining the position of the plot points, viewers can identify when there were periods of high or low animal intake or outcome, and how these factors impacted the overall animal population of the shelter. This information can be used to inform decision-making about adoption campaigns, outreach efforts, and other strategies to manage animal populations in the shelter.

Interaction 

Tooltip 

When a user mouseover a point, it would hover and show a tooltip with the number and date of this point. When user selects a type, the Type field on the tooltip will change accordingly.

Design Rationale

We use the x-axis of the heatmap to represent different intake types, and the y-axis to represent various intake conditions. Each cell represents a combination of an intake type and condition. The color of each cell is divided into five levels from light to dark, with lighter colors indicating less frequent occurrences in the database and darker colors indicating more frequent ones. To aid interpretation, we included a legend displaying quantity ranges corresponding to each color on the current heatmap.

To optimize user comprehension and aesthetic appeal, we made several design choices:



* We chose common dog colors for better visual appeal while ensuring that users can easily distinguish between lighter and darker shades. 
* We placed frequently occurring intake types and conditions in the upper left corner so that cells with darker colors are more likely to be located there.
* Evenly distribute colors throughout the heatmap by ordering cell counts into 5 groups.
* Combine groups with overlapping count ranges when ties occur during grouping (e.g., combining groups with count ranges from 0-1 and 1-2).

Interaction (DONE)

Creating a filter:


![alt_text](images/image12.png "image_tooltip")



    When a user clicks on a cell in the heatmap, it filters the data based on the combination of intake condition and intake type. The cell will be lightlighted with a black border. The filter is applied to the bubble chart to display the breed distribution of animals that fall under this combination of intake condition and intake type. The filter also applies to the bar & line chart, which shows the count and average time in shelter for different age groups of animals that fall under this combination of intake condition and intake type. Cells with a count of 0 cannot be clicked because there is no data available for this particular combination.

Filter Combination

	5.4 Heat Map selector could be used together with 5.1 type filter, and if there is a selected 5.2 stack brush, the user could use 5.5 based on 5.2 selection.

Receiving a filter from other views:


    
![alt_text](images/image13.png "image_tooltip")



    The heatmap can receive filtered data from all the other filters in the app. When receiving filtered data from other charts, the heatmap will adjust accordingly by changing its rows and columns based on how many intake conditions/types are present. Additionally, color groups will be distributed evenly without overlap, while frequently occurring conditions/types will appear in the upper left corner after recalculations are made using new data.

Hover & Tooltip (DONE)

Design Rationale

Bubble chart is used because we want to show both breed distribution and animal types in one chart. We select top 100 (or smaller than 100) breeds to show in the chart. When a user looks at the chart, they could first see the breed greatest percentage of count. Then, they could see the name of breeds that have the percentage larger than 1%, which compose the main breeds in the shelter. they could also differentiate animal types by color hue. While size coding is considered a medium effective channel, we give the count of animals in the tooltip to compare the similar size bubbles.

Design Rationale

We have designed this chart with the x axis representing different age groups and the left y axis showing the number of animals in each group. The right y axis displays the average time that animals in each age group spend in shelters. 

To enhance its visual appeal, we made several design choices:



* We have assigned a unique color to represent each age group, with lighter colors used for younger ages.
* We categorized animals by the most common age groups to categorize cats and dogs .
* To avoid confusion when interpreting the chart, we have implemented a feature where hovering over bars highlights the left y-axis with bold font while hovering over lines highlights the right y-axis with bold font.

Interaction (DONE)

Creating a filter:


![alt_text](images/image23.png "image_tooltip")



    When a user clicks on a bar in the chart, it filters the data based on the age group. The barl will be lightlighted with a black border. The filter is applied to the bubble chart to display the breed distribution of animals that fall under this age group. The filter also applies to the heatmap, which shows the count of each combinations of the intake condition and intake type for animals that fall under this age group.

Receiving a filter:


    
![alt_text](images/image24.png "image_tooltip")

![alt_text](images/image25.png "image_tooltip")



    The bar and line chart can receive filtered data from all the other filters in the app. When receiving filtered data from other charts, the barchart adjusts accordingly by changing the number of bars based on how many age groups are present. However, if there is only one age group present, a line cannot be formed and instead a point will be generated to represent the average time spent in shelter.

Filter Combination

	5.6 Bar chart selector could be used together with 5.1 type filter, and if there is a selected 5.2 stack brush, the user could use 5.5 based on 5.2 selection.

## 6 Usage Scenarios

**Scenario 1:**

Linda had been dreaming of adopting a pet for a long time. Finally, after moving to a larger house, she had the space and time to do so. She decided to visit the website of the nearby animal shelter to find out what kind of pet would be the perfect fit for her.

Upon visiting the website, Linda was impressed with the variety of data visualization tools that were available to help her with her search. She noticed an animal type filter at the top of the webpage, which allowed her to filter the animals by type. By clicking the button, she could see the data of each animal type, and find out more about them.


![alt_text](images/image28.png "image_tooltip")


Linda was curious about which animals were most popular at the shelter, so she looked at the stacked line chart. This chart showed the intake and outcome numbers over time, which gave her an idea of the overall animal population at the shelter. She was surprised to find that dogs were the most popular animals at the shelter, with the highest outcome and intake numbers.
![alt_text](images/image29.png "image_tooltip")


Then, Linda tried to select a random period of time to see the animal flows in one period.


![alt_text](images/image30.png "image_tooltip")


Next, Linda looked at the bubble chart, which showed the breed distribution of each animal type. She was happy to see that there were many breeds of dogs available, but noticed that pit bulls consisted of a large group of dogs. So she click pit bull mix to filter only pit pull.


![alt_text](images/image31.png "image_tooltip")


From the heatmap, she was concerned to see that a lot of the pit bulls were taken to the shelter because they were injured as she could tell the number range from the color of each rectangle and it would show a tooltip when her mouse moved to a single rectangle. Linda is a kind-hearted person and wanted to provide a loving home to an animal in need, so she decided to adopt a pit bull.


![alt_text](images/image32.png "image_tooltip")


Linda then looked at the bar chart, which showed the age distribution of the pit bulls. She noticed that most of the pit bulls were in the young age range of 0-2 years old. Linda wanted to adopt a young dog, so she decided to adopt a pit bull within that age range.


![alt_text](images/image33.png "image_tooltip")


Finally, Linda made an appointment to visit the shelter in person. She was excited to meet the pit bull she had chosen and see if they would be a good match. When she arrived, she was greeted warmly by the staff and shown around the facility. She spent some time with the pit bull, getting to know its temperament and personality. She found that they got along well and decided to adopt the dog.

Thanks to the data visualization tools on the animal shelter's website, Linda was able to make an informed decision and adopt the perfect pet for her. She was grateful for the tools that helped her navigate the adoption process and find the right animal for her family. She was excited to give her new pit bull a loving home and provide the care it needed.

7 Reflection 

How have your visualization goals changed?

M3:

Using a stacked graph to represent intake and outcome data in an animal shelter may seem like a reasonable approach at first, but upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that this method is flawed. Stacked graphs show the combined values of two or more variables, which in this case, would be intake and outcome data. However, adding the intake and outcome data together would not provide an accurate representation of what is happening in the animal shelter. This is because intake data represents the number of animals coming into the shelter, while outcome data represents the number of animals leaving the shelter. Therefore, these two variables should not be combined, but rather, the outcome data should be subtracted from the intake data to get the net change in animal numbers.

By splitting the stacked line graph, with the upper section representing intake data and the lower section representing outcome data, this subtraction is clearly represented. The split line graph provides a more accurate and informative representation of the changes in animal numbers over time, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of an animal shelter. Additionally, using a split line graph helps to avoid potential confusion or misinterpretation that may arise from using a stacked graph.

In summary, using a split line graph to represent intake and outcome data in an animal shelter is a more appropriate and accurate approach than using a stacked graph. It allows for clear representation of the net change in animal numbers and avoids potential confusion or misinterpretation that may arise from using a stacked graph.

M2: 

Our original design at Barchart was to use the y-axis to represent average time in shelter, and the x-axis to represent each individual age value in the database. However, after creating the barchart, we found that the age range in our database was very large - from 0 years old to 25 years old - resulting in a total of 25 different colored bars. This did not create an optimal visual effect as our intention was for users to view animals' time spent in shelters across different age groups, allowing them to determine which age group is more popular. However, when viewing information, users generally do not have a specific age group already in mind; for example, few users would think "I want a dog that is exactly 5 years old; neither 4 nor 6 will do." Instead, they typically have a general range of ages such as between two and five years old. Based on this idea, we used the most common method of categorizing cats and dogs by their ages: grouping those aged zero through two as babies; those aged two through five as young; those aged five through ten as mature; and those over ten as elderly. Although this may not apply to all types of animals, we hope it provides comfortable user experience for most people. Therefore we reduced the number of bars down to four while adding a legend so that users can clearly understand each age group's range. Additionally, we found that users might also be interested in knowing how many animals are present within each sheltered age group so we used bar height for quantity representation while adding another line representing average time spent inside shelters.

When we designed the heatmap, we originally planned to find the minimum and maximum values of the combination of intake condition and intake type in the database, and then divide this range into five equal parts as the range corresponding to each color. However, after completing the heatmap, we found that one combination (Normal and Stray) appeared much more frequently than other combinations. The uneven distribution of data frequency resulted in most cells being assigned to the range with the lowest value among the five ranges. Only one cell was assigned to the range with highest value. We wanted an equal number of cells for each color on the heatmap so that it not only looks better but also conveys more information to users. So we decided to sort all combinations by their occurrence frequency on the graph and divide them into five groups from smallest to largest, ensuring that each color represents one-fifth of all cells on graph. We also created a legend showing what each color represents.

How have your technical goals changed?

M2:

In the Heatmap we initially created, the attributes on the y-axis and x-axis were unordered. This means that the code would automatically place the attributes first discovered in the database at the top, and so on. Since each cell's color in the heatmap represents the number of occurrences of a combination of y-axis attribute (intake condition) and its corresponding x-axis attribute (intake type) in the database, we found that if we did not sort these attributes on both axes, then there would be a very random distribution of colors on our heatmap. We believed that this design still had room for improvement. Therefore, we sorted these y-axis attributes based on their frequency of occurrence in our database and placed those with higher frequencies at the top from highest to lowest frequency. We also did this for x-axis attributes by placing those with higher frequencies to leftmost positions. As a result, there was now a more distinct distribution of colors: darker cells appeared in upper-left corner while lighter ones appeared towards lower-right corner. Consequently, users who wants to find combinations with greater numbers naturally looks towards upper-left corner. 

M3:

We initially wanted to allow all chart filters to be layered. For example, I could select a time period in the timeline, a combination of intake condition and intake type in the heatmap, a breed in the bubble chart, and then view the age composition of animals that meet all of these conditions in the bar and line chart, as well as their average stay time in the shelter. However, when we actually started working on this feature, we discovered a problem. If we manipulate a chart to be able to filter out some data, the chart cannot be changed again because we need the chart to remain unchanged to show what content we have selected as a filter. However, when we interact with one chart, the other charts will change accordingly. Suppose we interact with Chart 1. Chart 1 will freeze to represent all the data. Charts 2, 3, and 4 will apply the data filtered by Chart 1. At this point, if we interact with Chart 2, Chart 2 will freeze with the data filtered by Chart 1. If we then interact with Chart 3, Chart 3 will freeze with the data filtered by both Chart 1 and Chart 2. Although the user can observe the results of Chart 4, they may be confused by looking at the other charts, wondering why Chart 1 has the most data, why Chart 2 has less data than Chart 1, and why Chart 3 has less data than Chart 2. Moreover, after three rounds of data filtering, the amount of data that can be represented by the last chart is already very small. In order to ensure that our app is easy for users to understand, we decided to only allow the animal type filter to be layered with filters in the charts, while the filters in all charts cannot be layered with each other. We think this is the most user-friendly approach.
